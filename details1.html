    Worn on the runway by model Marisol Kade during Madame Vélan’s Fall/Winter 2012 presentation at the Maison Lenoir salon show, Paris. Following the season, the gown entered a private client archive and was later acquired in a private sale by Adele. The artist famously wore the piece at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards (2014), where photographs of the gown were widely published.
